**Odesolve Project**
====

**Content**
-----

A odesolve.py file which contains my main code for making the function.
A test_odesolve.py file which is from the assignment website and it can also test my codes correct or not.
A Jupyter notebook which shows the meaning of my codes, how them work and also the plot which is made from the codes.

**Install**
-----

This programme need to be run in anaconda programming environment such as spyer with python 3.9

**Usage**
-----

This project aims to make some functions which can calculate the odes questions by using both Euler and RK4 method.Codes can also calculate with known values of input and get the results by using both Euler and RK4 method.This project can also calculate with different values of input and plot the image with the results by using both Euler and RK4 method.At last it can also calculate the error between the ture solution and the resultes from the function and plot them.
